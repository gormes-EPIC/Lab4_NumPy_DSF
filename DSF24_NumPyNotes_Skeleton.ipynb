    "### Why NumPy arrays?\n",
    "\n",
    "If NumPy arrays work the same as lists for the most part, then why are we even bothering with them at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, understanding how data is stored and manipulated is paramount to doing so efficiently. Since data scientists are often working with huge datasets, they are very intentional about the ways they choose to manipulate data. The differences between how Python stores data by default, in contrast to packages like NumPy or Pandas, are important nuances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a popular programming language in part because it's easy to use. One major difference between Python and other languages like C or Java is its *dynamic typing*. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a variable in Python, you can assign it a value of any data type(int, String, etc.) without having to declare the variable as a specific type. Later in your program, you can also reassign the variable to a different data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this may be a valid Python program:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 4\n",
    "x = \"four\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This same logic would cause an error in Java:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int x = 4;\n",
    "x = \"four\"; //throws Type mismatch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This flexibility makes Python easy to use, but also means that the Python interpreter is doing extra work behind the scenes to make this possible. Under the hood, the Python interpreter and the Python programs you create are written and compiled in C. This means everything you create in Python is really a C structure. **Variables in Python take up additional space compared to variables in both Java or C because they must store the data type, value itself, and other information.** [source](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.01-understanding-data-types.html)"

    "### How are NumPy arrays different?\n",
    "Just as Python variables have dynamic types, elements of lists in Python have dynamic types. \n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning a Python list can contain multiple types like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list = [True, \"2\", 3.0, 4]\n",
    "[type(item) for item in L3]\n",
    "# prints [bool, str, float, int]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, the underlying C compiler must account for multiple data types and stores additional information about each element. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fixed-type NumPy arrays lack the same flexibility, but are able to store information much more efficiently. **NumPy arrays are much more similar to Java and C arrays in their efficient implementation.**\n",
